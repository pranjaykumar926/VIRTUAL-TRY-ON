## ✨ Overview

In the digital era, shopping for jewellery online can be challenging without seeing how it looks when worn. **Virtual Try-On for Jewellery** solves this problem by leveraging computer vision and deep learning. The project demonstrates:

- **🎯 Real-Time Jewellery Detection:** Using a custom-trained YOLO model to detect jewellery pieces.
- **💻 Interactive Web Application:** Allows users to upload their photos or use a webcam for a virtual try-on.
- **🔗 End-to-End AI Pipeline:** Includes model training and an interactive web-based demonstration.

---

## 🎯 Features

- **✅ Accurate Jewellery Detection:** Uses YOLO for precise object detection.
- **🔧 User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use web app built with Python.
- **⚡ Real-Time Virtual Try-On:** Overlay earrings, necklaces, rings, and more in real time.
- **🛠️ Modular Codebase:** Clean and well-structured for future improvements.
- **🎮 Demonstrative Assets:** GIFs and a presentation (Ppt.pdf) included.
